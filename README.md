# cookiecutter-searchtool

I have provided the paper to outline in more detail how the metrics and the tool work.

Download the folders containing the templates and read me files for the top 300 most popular cookicutters.
You may need to change folder names and create an output folder.

Run the searchtool file and provide a cookiecutter from the top 300.

The tool returns the three most similar.

Enter a second template from this list and the tool will diff the structures and prompt an LLM to provide information on the functional differences between the two templates.
